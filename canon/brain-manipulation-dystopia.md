A dystopian future where we know how the brain signals desire, and can manipulate it: 
  
Secured areas are blocked off by an "I don't feel like going here" field that makes you want to leave.
  
Civilian regulators attempting to battle "yes" fields aimed at the sidewalk near stores.People adapt, overriding their instinct with rationality, with the unfortunate side effect of blunting their self awareness.
  
Taking a child anywhere is even more of a nightmare.  
  
The wealthy can afford FieldShield™️ wearables to remove commercial grade effects. These are jammed near government and military areas, like GPS is today.  

Overbearing parents and partners demand their loved ones override their desires, for their own security and peace of mind.  
  
"Voluntary" participation in workplace thought-manipulation schemes is increasingly required as a condition of employment.
