People sometimes get worked up about ghosting. I think in some cases, more equanimity is helpful.

## allowing a graceful exit

Some people are awkward; "I'm not interested" can be a difficult thing to communicate if you're a people pleaser who spends a lot of time up in their head. Not stressing too much about someone ghosting is a way to let them exit gracefully. That can be a kindness.

## when is ghosting okay?

IMO it depends on how established the relationship is:

✅ If you've only chatted and never met, it can lapse for any number of reasons. C'est la vie! (Try again if you like, but only once.)  
✅ After a first date, letting someone ghost allows a "graceful exit" (definition below);  
❌ More than that, I think you ought to be explicit about your (dis)interest.

Ultimately, **failure to follow up is itself an indication of non-interest**. It doesn't matter whether they're busy, or forgetful, or inconsiderate, or stuck in a shame-spiral about not getting back to you fast enough, or indeed simply not that into you - all of those are dealbreakers.

I do also wonder how much people saying "they ghosted me" is a sign of their own passivity. Did they send a message themselves, or did they expect to be contacted and are just in a silent "no you go first" stalemate? I truly do not know.

## my preferred protocol

If I'm not interested, I try to be clear about it: "it was good to meet you, I didn't feel a spark, good luck out there".

If I'm interested in someone, I will usually reach out to say I had fun and express interest: "it was good to meet you, I'd love to do it again sometime".

If no reply a couple of days later: "feel free to not reply if you're not interested, but if you are: how about \[suggestion\]".

And then that's it. They get one follow-up, and if still no reply, I make up whatever story I need to get over it and move on.
