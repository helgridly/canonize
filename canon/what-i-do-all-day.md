Every now and then someone asks me "what do you DO all day?", so here's some things I did yesterday (2024-11-16):

- day 2 of expressive writing therapy on the topic of surrender
- connect to my sacral chakra
- post about this website and the tooling for it
- pilates
- print off a return label at the library
- drop off a sweater to a tailor for mending
- visit a fabric store that specializes in silks
- visit a lunch spot I randomly noticed, drink the mango curry sauce from the plate with a straw 
- do some work on my project
- stop off at Eataly and buy a chocolate chip panettone for myself because I felt like it
- wander around MUJI, fail to find the shoehorns that were there last time
- research nail polish with Claude and buy one
- video myself [glorking](../glork-glork-glork)
- read a little of [Eastern Body, Western Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/576362.Eastern_Body_Western_Mind)

It's about a day's worth of stuff. The main difference is I spend little time feeling obligated to do things I don't want to do, which is very nice.
