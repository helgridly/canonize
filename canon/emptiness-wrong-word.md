I think "no-self" and "emptiness" are really bad descriptions.

If you press people on this, they often wriggle with "well it's no _fixed essence_ of self" or "it's actually emptiness of inherent _blah blah_", but the phrases are still very often used un-wriggled... and the wriggling is unconvincing anyway.

IMO "fullness", "everythingness" point at the experience better, and emptiness was almost exactly the wrong description.

That said: my experience was the one labelled "Big Mind" in this diagram from Roger Thisdell's ([related article](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/an-enlightened-mind-has-done-this-two-types-of-objectification)), so it's possible that "no-self" and "emptiness" are simply describing experiences I haven't had.
