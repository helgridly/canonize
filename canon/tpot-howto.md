From [Otis' guide](https://itsallme.substack.com/p/17d914f9-8f2c-4303-8543-78a3dfe5f15e):

> In broad strokes, tpot is a group of people on Twitter who value curiosity, openness, earnestness, intelligence, kindness, and vulnerability.

I recommend you read Otis' guide; it's fairly succinct.

Some longer ones that you could read:
* [Christine's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bd3PfKDL9pOM7YoxGbRBwO_qOWh6B7u5170Xw8VyK6s/edit?tab=t.0)
* [Tasshin's guide](https://tasshin.com/blog/a-guide-to-twitter/)

## my exhortations

You won't get the best of this scene as a passive observer. The real good stuff needs your participation and curation. Be yourself in your posts. Get in the replies of accounts you like, and contribute positively (kindly, encouragingly, thoughtfully); make friends there. Check the follows of people you like.

Most importantly, remember: your Twitter account is not an expression of your value as a person.

If you are starting to feel physically or emotionally tense, like this is an obligation or something you have to perform well at, I implore you to back off, take some space. Please, only do what comes freely and feels joyful.

And that includes not being here at all! It might not be the thing for you! That's fine!

## to get a toehold

Consider following [@voidlistening](https://x.com/voidlistening/). It is an account that retweets posts from small accounts; if you've just joined, that will be you! It has an intro thread [here](https://x.com/voidlistening/status/1833892349639901231); some of the content here has been lifted from it.
