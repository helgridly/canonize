## getting into a teleporter
  
* "No, they kill you and make a clone on the other side" - concerned with small self  
* "Oh sure, I'm just the universe expressing itself, it can do that anywhere" - flowy, self as verb  

## psychedelics

Whether I want to do ayahuasca (self-punishing, violent) or mushrooms (chill, expansive)

## shower temperature

I always used to be a super-hot shower person, but on my better days lately that's just felt uncomfortable and I've turned it down to a more pleasant warmish
