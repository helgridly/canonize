# journal entry, 2024-05-31

good god, i had two coffees after quitting caffeine a month ago and it fucked up my day for HOURS  
  
the things i tell myself, jfc. "you made a mistake, therefore everything that happens downstream of that is your responsibility and you're not allowed any accommodations for any difficulties it has caused you"  
  
the absolute fucking brutality ðŸ«‚
