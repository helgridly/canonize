Enlightenment discourse on Twitter can sometimes feel like Monty Python's "Nudge Nudge" sketch:

There's a way in which it's a bit like sex:
  
Beforehand, there can be lots of thinking about it, wondering what it's like, wanting it a lot, borderline obsession.
  
Then one day it happens. Maybe it was good or mediocre, but now it's just a thing that happened.

What do you do next? Up to you, same as before.  
  
Maybe you found it profoundly life-altering. Maybe you want to try and get good at it, make it your life's work.

But you don't have to -- maybe you'd rather go for a run, or learn woodworking!
