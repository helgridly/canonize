`<soundrotator>` Mocktails are just "what if you took beverages seriously"  

In my mocktail era  

They are not "virgin cocktails" they are chad beverages  

`<seflathing>` boozecels vs spritz rotators  

i am always somewhat outraged that they're charging $11 for fancy juice though  

`<sonikudzu>` for me it depends on the contents of the juice  
  
if they have to have a variety of exotic, perishable ingredients on hand to make me a beautiful mixture of them, or if they have to do something by hand(eg crush herbs or toast spices), then it seems fair  

`<seflathing>` yeah sure. but often it's soda with a dash of bitters and a flower, and i'm incensed  

at least do the dance with the shaker damnit
