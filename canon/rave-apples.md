I implore you: during apple season, try a Rave apple. They have the incredible satisfying snap of a honeycrisp coupled with a delicious tartness that will make you stomp your foot in appreciation.
  
I am not sponsored by Rave Apple Corporation Councilâ„¢, but I would work for them for free in exchange for a lifetime supply of Rave apples.
  
I spent all of fall 2023 searching for my apple. I believed it was out there waiting for me, only to be met with an endless drugery of crunchy sugar or thick-skinned mealy blandness. And just as I was about to give up, I found her. This is My Apple.

Please try a Rave apple.
