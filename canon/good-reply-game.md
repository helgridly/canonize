IME [Visa's "practice good reply game"](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/reply-game/) is fairly simple:  
  
❌ Argue  
❌ Asking them to solve your problem  
❌ Giving advice  
✅ Resonate. Offer something you're reminded of, an anecdote from your life, etc  
✅ If something touched you, simply saying what + how is GREAT. You don't have to "contribute".  

These "rules" aren't rules, they're behaviours downstream of an attitude / way of being: warm, open, thoughtful, lighthearted.  
  
e.g. you *can* give advice, but doing so warmly often means first asking a question to draw out more context. Which you won't if you have an axe to grind.

Similarly, you *can* ask questions, but there are good and bad kinds. The good kinds are generative: asking for more details, understanding the space, checking your understanding. Bad questions have a negative undertone: arguing, or assuming bad faith or downright idiocy ("have you considered extremely obvious thing?").
