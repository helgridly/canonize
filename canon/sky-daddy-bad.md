I've seen a lot of people stuck in this idea that you're either atheist or you believe in Sky Daddy. (I assume this is mostly a Western thing.) It's about who you worship, what are their Rules, what will happen after you die.

I've have had friends approach me with concern: "you're not becoming religious, are you?" -- like it's an infectious disease that preys on the vulnerable and scams them into giving up their agency.  

I have this way of being that I try to practice, and a felt sense that there's more than the superficial" is hard to grok without bringing in assumptions from the cultural frame of "powerful yet punitive being who you have to either please or hope for mercy from".

Or, in short:
