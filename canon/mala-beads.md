`<selflathing>` did you know that the "mala" in mala beads is the same ma la = numbing/spicy as in sichuan peppercorns -- because that's what the beads were originally made of!  
  
if you didn't know that, it's because i just made it up    

`<br___ian>` selflathing still gonna make a bracelet from all the pepper trees in my neighborhood  

`<selflathing>` did you know that meditation bells are made of the same bells that you find in bell peppers
