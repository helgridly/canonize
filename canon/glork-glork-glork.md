`<selflathing>` i'm a loud gulper. you give me a glass of water and i'll down it in one, glork glork glork all the way. feels fantastic  

`<latentjuice>` don’t even get me started on the satisfied “ahhh” sigh at the end. 4-year-olds know what’s up  

`<selflathing>` i have a friend who has picked up the t!-ahhhh, and it makes me cringe... but i think that's a me problem. i'm reading it as a bit because i'm too selfconscious to express the post-glork satisfaction  

`<latentjuice>` makes sense, i think it helps to fully commit to the bit. eg holding on to your drink with both hands like it’s a giant sippy cup. that way you can pass it off with plausible deniability

`<selflathing>` i'm not sure a sippy cup can sustain the flow rate necessary for a good glorking though. you can just about get it out of a regular water bottle but you have to suck it crushed as you go, which is a power move in its own right  

this makes me think there are 2 glork vibes: thirsty athlete and toddler. that might be too simplistic a model though  

`<latentjuice>` what if glorking (and other toddler behaviors) are independently discovered optimums before social conditioning constraints set in  
  
eg it’s the most efficient way to take in large quantities of water   
  
and pro athletes “re-discover” this mode

`<selflathing>` this argument feels perfectly tailored for me, i love it. you can probably sell me anything with "kids know this intuitively, we have to rediscover it as adults". love a midwit meme too  
  
also very much appreciate that you just rolled with calling it glorking, no questions asked  

i just glorked in honour of this conversation and stayed open to a t-ahhh. it came earlier than i expected, the last glork and "t-" were two eighth notes followed by the ahhh as final quarter note  
  
the ahhh definitely comes on a downbeat, might try adding a rest next time
