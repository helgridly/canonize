`<Temenosis>` New meditation practice: When you notice that you’ve forgotten to be present, rather than simply abiding in the nowness of experience, you should remind yourself of how bad you are at being present, then start strategizing ways to ensure that you never leave the moment again  

Here’s a mantra for you: “why am I so bad at staying in the moment? I’m so stuck in greed, craving and delusion. I’m not gonna make it. I’m damned.”   
  
Play with this in a way that works for you!  

`<seflathing>` Great tip. Really hits on the most important, core part of any meditation practice, which is beating yourself up as much as possible. Remember that there's *always* some way that you're not doing it right. Your goal is to eliminate ALL obstructions; only then can you be happy.  

`<Temenosis>` Wise words. This post really made me hate myself so I can be sure I’m on the right track.  

`<seflathing>` How else are you going to get the motivation to fix your problems? Great stuff, keep it up.  

To be clear, when we say "only then can you be happy", the "can" is a question of permission. If you seek unauthorized happiness before eliminating all obstructions, not only is it impossible but the Zen Police WILL find you.
