There's sometimes talk about "therapy language", usually in scare quotes. Some awful TikTok video of someone giving an inhuman breakup speech.

I think the name is misattributed. No therapist I've ever had speaks like that.
  
If you're struggling and find something that provides insight (+relief), I think there's a real danger of taking it on uncritically and running with it because it "feels true". "Here's a script to follow that avoids vulnerability and provides you a sense of safety" is compelling.

And it only takes one influencer misinterpreting a book, self-diagnosing etc to inject unskilled or inaccurate uses of the language into the zeitgeist. One example is the phrase "trauma bonding", which in the profession refers to the bond between _a trauma victim and their abuser_, but in the last few years is being used online to mean "bonding with another person over both having experienced trauma".

It is much easier for content creators and consumers to create + ingest "your parents were narcissists, grey rock them" than to teach introspection, self-acceptance, and open, skilful communication with good boundaries. Especially in the format of 30 second bites.
