I have an amazing and beautiful cat. He is friendly, communicates well, and everyone loves him.

Does this say anything about whether I will find a similarly amazing and beautiful partner?

Argument for no: these things are completely independent.

Argument for yes (less likely): I have enough skill points for "great cat" but not enough for "great partner". I instinctively knew this and went for the cat.

Argument for yes (more likely):  
- I have good taste, discernment, and patience  
- I am lucky  
- I can have a positive relationship without screwing it up
- A great partner will see my cat, and my relationship with him, as a positive sign  

A friend points out another possibility: the cat is a stat multiplier, intensifying my already existing qualities. On first inspection this tracks: I am more loving but my house is less clean!
