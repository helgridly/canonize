I love my cat so much. he's beautiful. Ten minutes gently purring with him on the sun bench and I changed my outfit.

His chin hairs are short, a fine stubble. His neck fur is long, tailing off in wisps. His whiskers are a different material altogether: solid, reaching columns. I blink at him and he half-blinks back, content in the sun. His nose is made of many tiny dots, like taste buds.

I think if I had a human love like this, I would burst.

It would be nice.
