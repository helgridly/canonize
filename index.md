I tweet a lot. This is an archive of tweets and threads I like; sometimes I turn them into articles.  
For more information on this project, see [about](about).

Below you can explore the articles. You can click at the top of the columns to filter by tags you're interested in. There are a lot of shitposts; if you'd prefer the more serious writing, check the "hide shitposts" box.

I think the best way to explore the writing is to pick an article that sounds interesting. At the bottom of the article are some tags; if you click one of the tags, it'll take you to a randomly selected article that also shares that tag. You can sorta explore your way around that way.
