I have always been a sharer. For a long time this meant that my partner (or an unlucky close friend, if I wasn't dating) would be subject to a firehose of stream-of-consciousness text messages from me, all day.

In early 2024, after learning about the scene called [tpot](https://itsallme.substack.com/p/17d914f9-8f2c-4303-8543-78a3dfe5f15e?s=w), I decided to spare my friends and move that behaviour to Twitter. Someone somewhere (still trying to figure out who!) gave me the idea that if you be yourself, people who like you will find you, and then magic happens. (If you want a long read on this, Aaron Z. Lewis has a piece on [the process of online identity forming](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/23/being-your-selves-identity-rd-on-alt-twitter/).)

So my Twitter habit is, roughly, to unfiltered barf almost everything that goes into my head. Sometimes that's shitposts, sometimes that's long threads about how I'm feeling, or something that's important to me. Sometimes a mutual will share something that inspires me to write an ungodly amount in response.

Over time this has resulted in a decent body of work - it turns out I have Things To Say - but while Twitter is a good place to generate ideas, it's hard to curate and share them. I suspect I am on about _something_, but I don't know what it is yet.

This project is an attempt to find out. There's [some machinery](https://github.com/helgridly/canonize) on the backend that shows me Twitter threads I've participated in, and lets me select the ones I think might be interesting. Those go into a pile of drafts, which I manually consolidate and tag, sometimes expand on, and then publish here as "canon".
