(kensho thread to come)

> seflathing  

@neats29 I had mine immediately after "well, at least I can be *a* Buddha"; and then everything all at once said "I am *all* Buddhas", and I was. self-as-Everything: tree, ocean, room I'm in. And other people, though it felt morally abhorrent to "be" someone else, so I didn't.  

> smallkewlhuman  

@selflathing interesting. can you say more about why it felt morally abhorrent?  

> seflathing  

so a bit more context: it seemed like i could "feel what it was like" to be a tree / the ocean / etc. even a small patch of ocean was very "big" and i backed off immediately, feeling like it'd overwhelm me  

when it came to people it felt like it'd be a really gross violation, like an invasion of privacy. fwiw my body nearly fell over at one point because i forgot i had to keep controlling one of the humans, so i was definitely... very altered
