`<selflathing>` is my longstanding annoyance with phrases like "i like going out but also staying in" on dating profiles just me beefing with people who can find joy in whatever they do?!  

`<meatballtimes>` @selflathing Maybe a small number of people mean it that way but I think most people are just deeply unintrospective and put nearly 0 thought into their responses. I haven't found those people to be happier than average  

`<selflathing>` @meatballtimes i do wonder if introspective people are aso because they're sad or traumatized in some way  
  
if true, then perhaps having a charmed life means you don't *need* to go rooting around in your psyche. what if happiness just DID come easier for some people  

@meatballtimes and i still find myself making up justifications, like "introspective people might be better off in the long run"! "some folks are better at being happy than me" is tough to swallow, and i'm not even a particularly happy person. plenty space on the right of the distribution  

@meatballtimes my sense of superiority relies on people who seem happy *actually* being dumb basic normies. ugly  

`<meatballtimes>` @selflathing I'm deeply worried about this dynamic too. Frankly less complicated and happy people simply have less inner work to do and that's a good thing actually.  
That said, I think everyone has things to work on and 0 introspection is almost certainly a bad sign  

`<selflathing>` @meatballtimes a good friend of mine skews pretty close to the stereotype above. he recently said to me, completely offhand: "you don't have to heal from everything, you know"  
  
it wasn't a dig or a gotcha. it was said almost in passing, like it was nothing  
  
i think about it a lot  

@meatballtimes what if some folks have a healthy + functional relationship to themselves and enough distress tolerance to muddle through and be generally content?  
  
maybe that's it. that's the bar  
  
what if i already had those skills, but i wail and gnash because i'm expecting  m o r e ?
