(I was trying way too hard when I wrote this thread, but it might factor into some writing about effort and surrender.)

> seflathing  

what is going on?  
i feel pain  
it hurts  
i don't want to  
i must relieve the pain by my effort  
the belief is: effort relieves suffering  

why effort? why not acceptance? or hugs?  
because effort means i am in control  
why do you need to be in control?  
to make the suffering go away!  

what might loopy say?

ease relieves suffering  
turn sideways, be the sheet of paper  
effort causes suffering  
the buddhist take. effort is grasping  
effort relieves _______?  
what is effort for?  

i am trying to find a new home for my effort  
i am quite attached to it  
it is something i love  
i love my effort. it is earnest, it wants things, it wants me to be happy  
it imagines a better life for me and tries to lead me there  

my effort is trying to find a place where it can relax  
hang out on a sun lounger, enjoy being warm, take a nap  

what if, effort, your work is done?  
we have a home. a job. financial stability. a cat. friends. comfort available, should we choose  
what more can we ask for?  
have we arrived?  

thank you, effort. i love you.  
for so long you tried. and, actually, i think you succeeded.  
because look! look around!  
rest, my love. this peace is ours

coda: what more can we ask for?  
love  
and yet  
i was here all along
