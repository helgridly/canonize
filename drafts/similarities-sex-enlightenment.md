`<selflathing>` enlightenment discourse  
https://t.co/QEfgA87wu9  

similarities between sex and enlightenment:  
  
there can be lots of thinking about it, wondering what it's like, wanting it a lot, borderline obsession  
  
then one day it happens. maybe it was good or mediocre but now it is just a thing that happened  

what do you do next? up to you, same as before.  
  
maybe you want to try and get good at it. make it your life's work. but you don't have to. maybe you'd rather go for a run, or learn woodworking.
