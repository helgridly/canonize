(I have some difficult feelings about Zen transmission, and whether it means anything, that I might write up one day.)

I think the role of "spiritual teacher" is actually a needed one  
  
And most people go a bit bonkers as soon as they get that status  
  
Help tpot what do?

@IkkyusDen I have deep reservations about Zen transmission. I've seen transmitted teachers who are going through life obviously unintegrated, causing great harm; and teachers who are simply underequipped to deal with student needs.  

@IkkyusDen For a tradition that likes to set up a didactic teacher/student dynamic it sure would be nice if teachers were meaningfully qualified.  

@IkkyusDen A practitioner with deep and broad ties across the Zen community *might* be able to query the grapevine to determine whether a lineage is reputable or beset by drama. But that's nigh-impossible for a new student.  

@IkkyusDen I wish I had an answer but I don't. As you can probably tell, this question is live for me! So far my approach is to try and find a different tradition that has a decent amount to say about "after kensho".
