(I have some difficult feelings about Zen transmission, and whether it means anything, that I might write up one day.)

> IkkyusDen  

I think the role of "spiritual teacher" is actually a needed one  
  
And most people go a bit bonkers as soon as they get that status  
  
Help tpot what do?  

> selflathing  

@IkkyusDen I have deep reservations about Zen transmission. I've seen transmitted teachers who are going through life obviously unintegrated, causing great harm; and teachers who are simply underequipped to deal with student needs.  

@IkkyusDen For a tradition that likes to set up a didactic teacher/student dynamic it sure would be nice if teachers were meaningfully qualified.  

@IkkyusDen A practitioner with deep and broad ties across the Zen community *might* be able to query the grapevine to determine whether a lineage is reputable or beset by drama. But that's nigh-impossible for a new student.  

@IkkyusDen I wish I had an answer but I don't. As you can probably tell, this question is live for me! So far my approach is to try and find a different tradition that has a decent amount to say about "after kensho".  


selflathing>     @nograsper @sabethunder the large number of awakened teachers who have still got up
                 to all sorts of unpleasant behaviour suggests that one does not necessarily follow
                 from the other

                 @nograsper @sabethunder taizan maezumi, eido shimano, richard baker come to mind
                 without much effort. maezumi even atoned for having an affair with a student and
                 even *still* ended up drowning in a bathtub because he was drunk

selflathing>     @cmilesb how does one regain trust after a betrayal? after abiding dubiousness?

                 not a theoretical Q. my old sangha is still going thru this

cmilesb>         @selflathing we’re all different in regaining trust. for me, it would mean an
                 honest acknowledgment and atonement plus changes to the sangha itself. i went ten
                 years without a sangha because I couldn’t find trust. eventually learned my doubt
                 was the problem. in west, i find this a

                 @selflathing particularly difficult issue as there are few reputable institutions.
                 there are no monastic universities. which of course aren’t perfect. but, in my
                 experience American buddhism has much stronger guru focus and individuality than in
                 India where I learned.

selflathing>     @cmilesb i suppose a notable failure to acknowledge and atone across a lineage is
                 in itself one way that lineage can be important + useful

                 i don't like the notion that people are tainted based on their lineage though.
                 feels judgemental, dismissive. might be a good thing nonetheless

cmilesb>         @selflathing channeling my teachers, they might say skillful thought can
                 differentiate the helpful teachings from the individual actions. so it’s up to you.
                 personally, i could not have really gone into deeper learnings if I didn’t love my
                 sangha and teachers. It’s tough.

selflathing>     @cmilesb yeah, i do feel like i've become unmoored since being out of spiritual
                 community. but it's been so hard to find another one which resonates

                 feels like there's a little longer in the wilderness for me yet
