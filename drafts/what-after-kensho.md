(I think I was on the "what after kensho?" kick for a while longer and might find some more tweets about it.)

> selflathing  

lately been wondering what comes after subtractive practice. dismantle your old scripts, kensho, etc: tada.wav ðŸŽ‰! then what? you're only halfway, need to rebuild. where's the guidance?  

"chop wood carry water" is crumbs; do we seriously send people along with a "congrats you saw Reality glhf", or did i miss a memo?  

possible answer: the eightfold path applies just as well afterwards, too
