(I want to write a longer thing extolling the virtues - and drawbacks - of date me docs. The asymmetry is one drawback; another is that it's an artificial escalation of intimacy that can make it harder to build the relationship organically)

`<selflathing>` few thoughts about date me docs, having had some experience:  
  
- i love the idea because 1) it allows creativity with the form 2) it lets ppl gauge their interest while staying anon  
- establishing mutual interest by exchanging docs is a delight compared to awkward rapport building  

- not always true that a paper match will translate to good vibes  
- if someone reaches out but doesn't have a doc of their own, i'm very aware of the asymmetry and feel off-balance. do i interview them until we're even???  

- i posted a link on my hinge profile and two people have hit like and then emailed me directly instead of waiting for the match! bypassing the mutual-match filter felt invasive (easy fix, just remove email + say contact me via however you found this)  

overall i really like it. feels like the old days of OKCupid when people would write novellas about themselves - i've missed that information density for a long time, glad it's back. getting good profile photos is still a bear though goddamn  

i suspect given my plans to move next year, it's unlikely anything will come of it. i ought to get in with the london tpot crowd but afaict the london scene is less vocal in general and i think might also skew younger
