`<danielbrottman>` hot take but don't ghost people  

`<frideswyth>` @danielbrottman I‚Äôve had people lash out very angrily when I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm not interested after a date   
  
So   
  
Depends  

`<justavagrant_>` @danielbrottman At least, ‚Äúconsider the impact on people before you do so, which is perhaps bigger than you are aware‚Äù  

`<martinmalindacz>` @danielbrottman im just taking my time (a lot of it) üò¨  

`<chercher_ai>` @danielbrottman ghosts: üòí  

`<danielbrottman>` @chercher_ai hahahah üëª  

`<_silentjacob_>` @danielbrottman I go back and forth on this‚Ä¶ what about when the alternative is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see or talk to you because your energy is not okay for me‚Äù? Often doesn‚Äôt seem like a helpful or loving thing way to set a boundary. Ghosting can send a message without adding insult to injury.  

`<danielbrottman>` @_silentjacob_ I don't think so, personally. ghosting feels likeore of an insult to me. you don't have to say "your energy is not okay for me" to someone on a dating app or something, you can just say "I don't think we're a good match"  

unless maybe it's a safety strategy in which case ok that's chill  

`<selflathing>` @danielbrottman (assuming we're talking about dating)  
  
i think  
1. "failure to follow up" is itself an indication of non-interest, it doesn't have to be explicit  
2. it's considerate to allow people a graceful exit, and being okay with ghosting is one way to do that  

@danielbrottman depends on how established the relationship is, imo  
- if you've only chatted and never met, it can lapse for any number of reasons. c'est la vie (try again if you like, but only once)  
- after first date counts as graceful exit  
- more than that i think you oughta be explicit  

@danielbrottman also i wonder how much people saying "they ghosted me" is just passivity - did they send a message themselves? i truly do not know this (it's not an accusation)  

@danielbrottman imo the ideal is:  
"it was good to meet you, i didn't feel a spark, good luck out there"  
  
on getting ghosted:  
"it was good to meet you, i'd love to do it again sometime"  
[couple days later]  
"feel free to not reply if you're not interested, but if you are: how about [suggestion]"  

`<danielbrottman>` @selflathing yeah there are a variety of circumstances, one is not always obligated to actually say "I don't want to talk any more" or whatever. also Jess pointed out that it may be a safety thing sometimes as men can be angry or threatening when being rejected :(  

`<selflathing>` @danielbrottman totes. and you can't really know whether they're afraid, or inconsiderate, or just forgetful (potentially even frozen in a shame-spiral about not getting back to you fast enough)  
  
you're allowed one follow-up. then just make up whatever story you need, grieve and move on  

@danielbrottman non attachment to outcomes babyyyyyy
