("fake it til you make it" feels like it's going to end up as a section in a "cargo cult outcomes" / confusing process with outcome article; keeping these as notes until then)

> polyascension  

this this this. i think the major hangup with fake it till you make it is we think it’s always going to be a character and ppl are gonna know.  
  
but when you change yourself by playing a character -  

you find people believe that you actually have the character’s traits.  
  
then, you realize you’re doing “the character” even on your own.  
  
finally, you realize the distinction is pointless; everyone thinks you’re him, you are doing him even when no one is watching — you are him.

@polyascension i think my problem with fake it til you make it is the faking it. if you can try it, experiment with it, play around: fantastic. but faking it feels inauthentic  
  
this might just be semantics, in which case never mind  

> polyascension  

@selflathing what are the semantics around trying it vs faking it in your view?  

> seflathing  

@polyascension great q. i think faking it implies some dishonesty - not wanting to be caught, by either the audience or yourself. the sense that there is something to "get away with" or someone to fool  
  
you're just being a person. maybe a diff kind of person to "normal" but so what  

@polyascension i guess that if you identify with the self critical part that thinks you can't do it, that you're Just Not That Person, then "fake it" makes sense = fooling that part. but i still think more pleasant to frame as experiment/trying it  
  
huge mental shift to treat things lightly tho
