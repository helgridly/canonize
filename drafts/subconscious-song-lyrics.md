`<selflathing>` ok, there it is: i miss my home.  
  
i've been living away from the city i love for 11 years. i went back for a visit a few months ago and oh god, i hadn't realized how much i missed it  
  
am making plans to move back, but it doesn't stop the longing

as usual, my subconscious was speaking to me through song lyrics  
  
"i made a promise to distance myselfâ€¦. it hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing with you"  
  
"isn't it strange / how people can change / from strangers to friends, friends into lovers, and strangers again"  

it's funny how i see the city as my lover. in a way it is - i feel truly alive when i'm there. absolute, undeniable belonging  
  
and less metaphorically, my romantic life is effectively on hold until i move back, bc finding a LTR resilient to crossing an ocean feels nigh impossible  

glad to let that move. felt good to cry: yes, i miss you so terribly, terribly much. i want to be home, with you, my love.  
  
sigh.
