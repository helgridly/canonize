> br___ian  

ok this is stupid but I would love to know what ppl in this or adjacent spaces my mutuals think are super legit, like somewhat trustworthy or walk the walk or whatever that means for their schtick  

if you want: tag someone you've met who you think is very legit  

> GeorgePunished  

@br___ian @PiquantParvenu without a doubt.  

> gptbrooke  

@br___ian Too many to tag 😩 I keep thinking of some and then of more and more  

> not_a_hot_girl  

@br___ian I have thought about the flip side/negative part of this a bunch bc I am as I say naive and I often believe the self people present to me, before realizing later that people will fake it til they make it and some never make it  
  
Which is to say: some ppl here do talk a big game  

> bashu_thanks  

@br___ian I aspire to be on this list and I think there are good reasons I'm not. I am legit at some things and I think I'd like to be legit at others  

@br___ian @gptbrooke but like, it very obviously does not bear mentioning Imao  

> br___ian  

in a session with @nowtheo he helped me get to some kind of core state and I literally watched the bad part of a memory from when I was little get dissolved by the warm safety vibes  

> selflathing  

@br___ian can you say a bit more about what you mean by legit? do you mean some kind of expert? extremely authentic / not-trying-to-sell-something vibes? something else?  

> br___ian  

@selflathing a lot of people talk about some thing they do  
  
some of them are actually good at the thing, it feels resonant, it's not just a piece of ideological / social camouflage  

> selflathing  

@br___ian ok this resonates. my personal criteria is "does not appear to be striving for clout"  
- i like @ehipassiko444's replies a ton  
- people who i like and admire for authentically expressing themselves: @meridians_ @mettafied @smiling_for_fun @rutabaga @junemarie @sonikudzu  

@br___ian @ehipassiko444 @meridians_ @mettafied @smiling_for_fun @rutabaga @junemarie @sonikudzu i am basically allergic to anyone who makes proclamations about the world or how one ought to be in it. deeply suspicious of anyone with follower counts in the 10k+ range. i honestly hope i follow majority sub-200 follower accounts forever  

@br___ian @ehipassiko444 @meridians_ @mettafied @smiling_for_fun @rutabaga @junemarie @sonikudzu also i don't think it's stupid. i think it's a very good question

Jarsen>          @dpinkshadow Oh yeah. I remember this guy. He was the one who was like “ever since
                 I got enlightened I am uninterested in the people around me”
                 1815384481404174700 @dpinkshadow 1815362396703142105

dpinkshadow>     @Jarsen lmao

selflathing>     @Jarsen @dpinkshadow this is validating and hilarious, ty for sharing
                 1815387772540067929 @Jarsen 1815384481404174700

                 @dpinkshadow i didn't get myself blocked but i did unfollow him some time ago. a
                 common type of guy around here and not one i'm interested in engaging with

                 i doubt you will find this a huge loss

`<selflathing>` me to claude: i think people should stop making general claims about how the world is or should be, and instead only talk about their personal experience.

claude: you realize that's a general claim about how the world should be, right?

owned. destroyed by my own facts and logic

in any case the words i was looking for were "epistemic humility" and "perspectivism", so that's cool

`<selflathing>` the nice thing about only sharing your perspective and lived experience is that nobody gives a shit, which prevents you from turning into a little goblin hooked on creating engagement bait for the algorithm

instead you and your *check* 271 followers can just be nice chill people
