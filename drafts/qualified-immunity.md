i agree this is a batshit take but:

qualified immunity is buddhist causes and conditions for cops

asking the question "in that moment, with the situation as it was, and your entire life's experience so far, could you possibly have done anything differently?"

& answering no

cops don't have free will and nor do the rest of us

just hope your life experiences don't lead you to becoming a cop
