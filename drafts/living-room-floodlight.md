`<selflathing>` ok, a review of having a 500W floodlight in your living room:  
  
first reaction: oh god this light is UGLY. extremely harsh  
  
but i got used to it pretty quickly and happily did a couple hours admin while being smashed by 42 thousand lumens https://t.co/IdKhfzcvHp  

turning it back off i was struck by how dim the house felt in comparison. i had read "your eyes adjust to light" but it's a completely different thing to experience, especially indoors  
  
it is not winter here and i am decently well light charged so i can't speak to SAD effects yet  

it is a LOT of light. the only comparison i can make is - and i apologise for this - it's something out of skibidi toilet. you can physiologically feel the VWOAAAAR  
  
it is absolutely NOT mood lighting. the only time i'd use it at a party would be as a mean "time to go home" joke  

there's no escaping it: the thing is ugly as sin. would be better if it wasn't protruding from the wall so much; it feels out of place, like an outdoor-type security camera might be  

`<yyallian>` @selflathing looks like lights theyâ€™d use in underground parking lots   
  
iâ€™d prob get one of these if they didnâ€™t heavily conflict w my aesthetic sensibilities  

`<selflathing>` @yyallian you can get high output corn lights, which you can at least put in a lamp. but they don't give as much light so you'd need multiple (or then just have less light)  
  
i picked the cheaper + less complicated solution to see how it works out. could see myself changing approach later  

`<yyallian>` @selflathing annoying to have multiple light sources tho, feel like it would cast too harsh of shadows. iâ€™m too particular abt fixtures, plus my house doesnâ€™t have tons of surfaces to put them on anyway!   
  
for you, what abt making it look built it instead of changing the entire unit?  

`<selflathing>` @yyallian yeah, getting it mounted flush-er would make a big difference. could remove 4in from the bracket arms if i had the tools to cut and drill sheet metal  
  
and could hide the wire nuts behind the unit  
  
i'm a bit wary of enclosing it because it puts out a decent amount of heat  

`<yyallian>` @selflathing thatâ€™s an option yeah  
  
if you choose to enclose it by cutting into the drywall, you can also place a vent on the other side right  

`<selflathing>` @yyallian you mean cut entirely through that wall and vent into the room behind it? damn that's serious ðŸ˜†  

`<yyallian>` @selflathing if youâ€™re hacking away at walls anyway, might as well right ðŸ˜­  

`<selflathing>` this made it onto FYP huh? weird  

`<baoteching>` @selflathing wow! do you feel any noticeable difference in your wellbeing?  
I wonder what it's like for people who move to a tropical country from a place with winters - if they also feel a significant effect or will the humidity catches up with them  

`<selflathing>` @baoteching i can't answer that question yet - it is summertime where i am and i am well charged up on light. will be january or so before we can tell  

i've used this on a few cloudy days since, and one thing i've noticed is it gives me a lot more focus. often this means i get sucked into spending a long time chitchatting on twitter, so it's not an unalloyed good. i didn't expect "less distracted" as an effect but seems so  

`<meekaale>` @selflathing do these things have any kind of LED driver buzzing or noise? I'm guessing silent but if they're made for warehouses or stadiums that wouldn't be in the quality control  

`<selflathing>` @meekaale yes, but it's very quiet. i only noticed it with my head right next to it  

`<meekaale>` @selflathing what's ur model? there are so many, I've wanted to order one for so long but online shopping for imported commodity electronics is such a nightmare  

`<selflathing>` @meekaale it is just... A Thing i found. didn't do too much research  
  
be aware that it doesn't come with a plug, so you'll need to buy romex and a plug and be comfortable wirenutting yourself  
  
https://t.co/vpQk5cJ6nm  

@meekaale my ultimate plan is to have it hooked up to home automation but for a while i intend to plug it in manually so i can check to see if it's on fire  

`<meekaale>` @selflathing I still have this feeling like oh it's just an LED lamp but then I remember it's more like 100 LED lamps  

@selflathing check out my LED thread it has some good ideas  

`<selflathing>` @meekaale well that was a wild ride
